Bill Connelly Project Topic

Predict the concentration of properties available for rent based on economic and demographic data from the American Community Survey and the Census Bureau more generally. The source of information for available properties will be the Zilyo API (https://market.mashape.com/zilyo/zilyo#) and the various datasets and APIs available on the at: https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets.html.  I will examine factors such as the number of per capita income, levels of poverty, income of the county and of the surrounding urban area, businesses in an area, business type, demographic makeup of the area, prevalence of families, rates of divorce, religious observance, and crime. I will examine the factors in three different urban areas that are representative of different economic and cultural segments of the United States (New York, Lo Angeles, New Orleans) and attempt to determine whether demographic and cultural factors or economic ones are more important in predicting the saturation of properties for rent on sites such as AirBnB, Home Away etc.  If possible I will try to predict the saturation of listing at the level of zip codes but initial research into the data suggests that the county level may be the level of focus.
